# Taxonomy Navigator - AI-Powered Product Categorization System (TypeScript)

An intelligent, optimized AI classification system that automatically categorizes products into appropriate taxonomy categories using OpenAI's GPT models with aggressive anti-hallucination measures and AI-powered summarization.

**This is a TypeScript implementation** that maintains complete feature parity with the original Python version.

## 🚀 Quick Start - See It In Action!

**Want to understand how this works? Start here:**

```bash
# First, install dependencies
cd typescript-taxonomy
npm install

# Build the TypeScript code
npm run build

# Run the batch tester to see the system in action:
npm run batch-test

# When prompted, enter the number of products to test (e.g., 3)
# Watch as the AI classifies products step-by-step!
```

This will show you:
- How the AI progressively narrows down from thousands of categories to one
- The actual AI decision-making process at each stage
- How batch processing ensures all categories are accessible
- Why numeric selection eliminates misspelling errors
- Why some stages are skipped for efficiency

## 🎯 System Overview

The Taxonomy Navigator uses a sophisticated progressive filtering approach with AI-powered summarization and numeric selection that efficiently narrows down from 5,000+ categories to a single best match.

## Usage

### Interactive Mode
```bash
npm run interactive
```

### Batch Testing with Visualization
```bash
npm run batch-test
```

### Classify Single Product
```bash
npm run classify -- "iPhone 14 Pro: Smartphone with advanced camera"
```

### Analyze Batch of Products
```bash
npm run analyze-batch
```

### Programmatic Usage
```typescript
import { TaxonomyNavigator } from './typescript-taxonomy';

const navigator = new TaxonomyNavigator({
  taxonomyFile: './data/taxonomy.en-US.txt',
  apiKey: 'your-api-key'
});

const result = await navigator.classifyProduct(
  'Samsung 65-inch QLED TV with smart features'
);

console.log(result.leafCategory); // "Televisions"
console.log(result.bestMatch);    // "Electronics > Video > Televisions"
```

## The Core Challenge We're Solving

**The Problem**: Google Product Taxonomy contains 5,000+ categories organized in a complex hierarchy. Asking AI to pick one category from 5,000 in a single step would be:
- **Expensive**: Massive prompts with thousands of options
- **Inaccurate**: Too many choices lead to poor decisions
- **Prone to hallucination**: AI might invent categories that don't exist

**Our Solution**: A carefully designed 5-stage process that progressively filters from 5,000+ categories down to 1, using:
- **AI Summarization**: Extract category-relevant features
- **Progressive Filtering**: 5,000 → 2 → 60+ → 1
- **Numeric Selection**: Eliminate misspelling errors
- **Batch Processing**: Ensure every category is reachable
- **Smart Skipping**: Save API calls when possible

## How It Works - The 5-Stage Process

### 📝 Preliminary Stage: AI Summarization

**What it does:** The AI creates a focused 40-60 word summary of your product for initial categorization.

**Why we added this stage:**
- **Problem**: Product descriptions are often long (500+ words) with marketing fluff, specs, and irrelevant details
- **Solution**: Extract only category-relevant information
- **Example**: A 500-word iPhone listing becomes: "Smartphone (mobile phone, cell phone). Mobile device for communication and computing. Features 6.7-inch display, A16 processor, triple-camera system. Runs iOS. Used for calls, apps, photography, and internet access."

**Design choices:**
- **40-60 words**: Long enough for detail, short enough to be focused
- **Starts with product type**: "Television" not "Home entertainment display"
- **Includes synonyms**: "(TV, flat-screen display)" helps match various category names
- **Category-focused**: Features that matter for categorization, not marketing claims
- **Model**: `gpt-4.1-nano` (sufficient for extraction tasks)

### 🎯 Stage 1: Finding Main Categories

**What it does:** The AI looks at your product summary and picks the 2 most relevant main sections of the catalog.

**Why pick 2 categories?**
- **Problem**: Products often fit multiple top-level categories
- **Solution**: Explore both paths to find the absolute best match
- **Example**: A smartwatch could be in "Electronics" OR "Apparel & Accessories"
- **Benefit**: We don't miss the best category by being too narrow early

**Design choices:**
- **Exactly 2**: Balance between coverage and efficiency
- **From ~21 options**: All top-level categories shown at once
- **Based on summary**: Consistent, focused input

### 🔍 Stage 2: Finding Specific Categories

**What it does:** For each main category from Stage 1, the AI picks relevant specific categories using numeric selection.

**The Breakthrough: Numeric Selection (v12.3)**
```
❌ OLD WAY - AI returns text:
Prompt: "Select categories for this TV"
AI Response: "Television, TV Mount"
Problem: Should be "Televisions" (plural) and "TV Mounts" (plural)
Result: 0 matches found, classification fails!

✅ NEW WAY - AI returns numbers:
Categories shown as:
1. Home Theater Systems
2. TV Mounts
...
315. Televisions

AI Response: "315, 2"
Result: Perfect match every time!
```

**The Challenge: Batch Processing**
- **Problem**: Token limits prevent showing 900+ categories at once
- **Solution**: Process in batches of 100
- **Example**: Electronics (339 categories) = 4 batches
  - Batch 1: Categories 1-100
  - Batch 2: Categories 101-200
  - Batch 3: Categories 201-300
  - Batch 4: Categories 301-339 (includes "Televisions" at 315!)

**Why 15 selections per batch? (v12.4)**
- **v12.3**: 15 total across ALL batches (too limiting)
- **v12.4**: 15 PER batch (comprehensive coverage)
- **Example**: 4 batches × 15 = up to 60 selections for Electronics
- **Benefit**: Complex products get thorough categorization

### 🏆 Stage 3: Making the Final Choice

**What it does:** The AI looks at all the specific categories found and picks the single best match using the AI-generated summary.

**Why use summary here?**
- **Consistency**: All stages now use the same concise summary
- **Focus**: The 40-60 word summary with synonyms provides sufficient context
- **Speed**: Faster processing with shorter input
- **Predictability**: Same context across all stages leads to more consistent results

**Smart optimization:**
- **Skip if only 1 option**: No need to choose when there's no choice
- **Model upgrade**: `gpt-4.1-mini` for balanced accuracy and cost
- **Numeric selection**: Continues to prevent errors

## 🏗️ Architecture Deep Dive

### **Design Philosophy**

Our system is built on these core principles:

1. **Progressive Refinement**: Start broad (5,000 categories) and narrow down gradually
2. **Adaptive Processing**: Skip unnecessary stages when possible
3. **Cost Optimization**: Use cheaper models (nano) for simple tasks, better models (mini) only when needed
4. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Every category must be reachable (batch processing)
5. **Zero Hallucination**: Numeric selection + validation at every step
6. **Transparent Process**: Clear visibility into AI decisions

### **Why This Specific Architecture?**

**Alternatives We Considered and Rejected:**

1. **Single-Stage Classification** ❌
   - Idea: Show all 5,000 categories at once
   - Problems: Token limits, poor accuracy, high cost
   - Why rejected: Technically impossible and ineffective

2. **Keyword-Based Filtering** ❌
   - Idea: Use keyword search to narrow categories first
   - Problems: Misses relevant categories, depends on exact wording
   - Why rejected: "TV" wouldn't find "Televisions"

3. **Fixed Category Limits** ❌
   - Idea: Always select exactly 15 categories
   - Problems: Some products need 5, others need 50
   - Why rejected: One size doesn't fit all

4. **Uniform Model Usage** ❌
   - Idea: Use gpt-4.1-mini for everything
   - Problems: 3x more expensive, overkill for list selection
   - Why rejected: Wastes money on simple tasks

5. **Embedding-Based Similarity** ❌
   - Idea: Use vector embeddings to find similar categories
   - Problems: Need exact matches, not similarity
   - Why rejected: "Television" ≈ "Monitors" in embeddings, but wrong category

**Why Our Approach Works:**
- **Progressive**: Natural narrowing from broad to specific
- **Efficient**: 3-20 API calls depending on complexity
- **Accurate**: Numeric selection + full coverage
- **Flexible**: Adapts to product complexity
- **Cost-effective**: ~$0.002 per classification

### **Model Selection Strategy**

| Stage | Model | Why This Model? | Cost |
|-------|-------|-----------------|------|
| Summary | `gpt-4.1-nano` | Simple extraction task | $0.0001 |
| Stage 1 | `gpt-4.1-nano` | Pick from 21 options | $0.0001 |
| Stage 2 | `gpt-4.1-nano` | Pick from lists | $0.0001-0.001 |
| Stage 3 | `gpt-4.1-mini` | Balanced accuracy and cost for final decision | $0.0005 |

**Total cost**: ~$0.001-0.002 per product (optimized for cost efficiency)

**Key insight**: All stages now use the same 40-60 word AI-generated summary with synonyms, providing consistency throughout the classification process.

## 🚨 Anti-Hallucination Measures

### **The Hallucination Problem in AI Classification**

Without proper measures, AI classification systems fail in predictable ways:
- **Inventing categories**: AI creates plausible-sounding but non-existent categories
- **Misspellings**: "Television" instead of "Televisions"
- **Wrong level**: Selecting "Electronics" when asked for specific categories
- **Format errors**: Returning explanations instead of just category names

### **Our Multi-Layer Defense System**

### **Zero Context Between API Calls**

**Why this matters:**
- **Problem**: AI "remembers" previous attempts and compounds errors
- **Solution**: Each API call starts fresh
- **Example**: If Stage 1 hallucinates, Stage 2 won't be influenced
- **Implementation**: New client/thread for each call

## ⚡ System Architecture Benefits

✅ **Complete Coverage**: Batch processing ensures ALL taxonomy categories are accessible
✅ **Zero Misspellings**: Numeric selection eliminates typing errors  
✅ **Efficiency**: Progressive filtering (5,000 → 2 → 60+ → 1)
✅ **Cost Optimization**: ~$0.002 per classification (70% savings)
✅ **AI Summarization**: Focuses on category-relevant features
✅ **Accuracy**: Each path explored independently with validation
✅ **Scalability**: Handles taxonomies with 900+ categories per section
✅ **Smart Models**: Right model for right task (nano vs mini)
✅ **Adaptive**: Skips unnecessary stages automatically

## 🤔 Frequently Asked Questions

### Why not use embeddings/vector search?
- **Need exact matches**: "Televisions" must match exactly, not find similar categories
- **Hierarchical structure**: Embeddings don't understand parent-child relationships
- **Official taxonomy**: Must use Google's exact category names

### Why not fine-tune a model?
- **Taxonomy changes**: Google updates categories regularly
- **No training data**: Would need millions of labeled examples
- **Our approach adapts**: Works with any taxonomy file automatically

### Can I use different models?
- **Yes**: Change via `--model` parameter or in code
- **Recommendations**: Keep nano for stages 1-2 (saves money), upgrade stage 3 if needed
- **Tested models**: gpt-4.1-nano, gpt-4.1-mini, gpt-4.1 (overkill)

### How do I reduce costs further?
1. **Cache results**: Same products always get same category
2. **Batch similar products**: Group by product type
3. **Adjust selection limits**: Reduce from 15 to 10 per batch (may impact accuracy)

### What about rate limits?
- **Default**: ~10 products/second sustainable
- **Burst**: Can handle 50+ products/second briefly
- **Solution**: Implement rate limiting in your application
