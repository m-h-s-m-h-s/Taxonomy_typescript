/**
 * TypeScript type definitions for the Taxonomy Navigator system.
 * 
 * This module defines all the interfaces and types used throughout the
 * taxonomy classification system, providing strong typing for better

 * 
 * TYPE ORGANIZATION:
 * - Configuration types: System behavior customization
 * - Data structure types: Taxonomy representation
 * - Result types: Classification output format
 * - Processing types: Internal batch processing
 * 
 * DESIGN PRINCIPLES:
 * - Optional fields use ? for flexibility
 * - Required fields enforced at construction time
 * - Detailed property documentation for clarity
 * - Consistent naming conventions
