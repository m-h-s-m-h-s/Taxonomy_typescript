Taxonomy Navigator - AI-Powered Product Categorization System

This module implements a sophisticated AI classification system that automatically 
categorizes products into appropriate taxonomy categories using OpenAI's GPT models.

=== OPTIMIZED CLASSIFICATION PROCESS WITH AI SUMMARIZATION ===

The system uses AI-generated product summaries for initial categorization (stages 1-2)
while preserving full product details for final selection (stage 3):

üìù PRELIMINARY STAGE: AI PRODUCT SUMMARIZATION (NEW)
   - Purpose: Generate focused 40-60 word summary for categorization
   - Model: gpt-4.1-nano (efficient summarization)
   - Process: Extract key product type, features, uses, and distinguishing characteristics
   - Output: Concise product summary without marketing fluff
   - Key Feature: Provides consistent, optimized input for stages 1 and 2

üéØ STAGE 1: L1 TAXONOMY SELECTION (AI-Powered)
   - Purpose: Identify the 2 most relevant top-level taxonomy categories
   - Input: AI-generated product summary + ALL unique L1 taxonomy categories
   - AI Model: gpt-4.1-nano
   - Process: AI selects 2 most relevant L1 categories (e.g., "Electronics", "Apparel & Accessories")
   - Output: List of 2 L1 category names
   - Key Feature: Uses focused summary for accurate broad categorization
   - Anti-Hallucination: Professional prompting + strict validation that every returned category exists

üîç **STAGE 2A: FIRST L1 LEAF SELECTION** (AI-Powered with Batch Processing)
- **Purpose**: Select best leaf nodes from the FIRST chosen L1 taxonomy
- **Model**: `gpt-4.1-nano` (efficient model for leaf selection)
- **Input**: AI-generated product summary
- **Process**: 
  * Processes categories in batches of 100 (e.g., 339 Electronics categories = 4 batches)
  * AI selects by number to avoid misspellings (e.g., "315" for Televisions)
  * Up to 15 selections per batch (e.g., 4 batches = up to 60 selections possible)
- **Output**: Combined list of leaf nodes from all batches
- **Anti-Hallucination**: Numeric selection + batch validation

üîç **STAGE 2B: SECOND L1 LEAF SELECTION** (AI-Powered with Batch Processing) - CONDITIONAL
- **Purpose**: Select best leaf nodes from the SECOND chosen L1 taxonomy
- **Model**: `gpt-4.1-nano` (efficient model for leaf selection)
- **Input**: AI-generated product summary
- **Process**: Same batch processing as Stage 2A (15 per batch)
- **Output**: Combined list of leaf nodes from all batches
- **Condition**: SKIPPED if only 1 L1 category was selected in Stage 1
- **Anti-Hallucination**: Numeric selection + batch validation

üèÜ STAGE 3: FINAL SELECTION (AI-Powered)
   - Purpose: Make the final decision from the combined leaf nodes from Stages 2A and 2B
   - Input: FULL product description + up to 30 leaf nodes from combined Stage 2 results
   - AI Model: gpt-4.1-mini
   - Process: 
     * Construct clear, professional prompt with specific constraints
     * Present up to 30 categories as numbered options (leaf names only)
     * AI identifies core product and selects best match using FULL details
     * Parse AI response with robust validation and bounds checking
     * Return guaranteed valid index of selected category OR -1 for complete failure
   - Output: Index of selected category (0-based, guaranteed valid) OR -1 for complete failure
   - Key Feature: Uses FULL product description for nuanced final decision
   - Condition: SKIPPED if only 1 leaf selected in Stage 2
   - Anti-Hallucination: Professional prompting + numeric validation + bounds checking + "False" for failures

=== SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE BENEFITS ===

‚úÖ Efficiency: Progressive filtering (thousands ‚Üí 2 L1s ‚Üí variable leaves ‚Üí 1)
‚úÖ Cost Optimization: 3-5 API calls per classification (adaptive)
‚úÖ Smart Summarization: AI extracts relevant details, removes marketing fluff
‚úÖ Consistency: All stages use the same AI-generated summary for predictable results
‚úÖ Accuracy: Consistent context across all stages improves reliability
‚úÖ No Truncation: No arbitrary character limits that might exclude key details
‚úÖ Scalability: Handles large taxonomies without overwhelming the AI
‚úÖ Model Strategy: Uses gpt-4.1-nano for summarization and stages 1-2, gpt-4.1-mini for stage 3

=== KEY TECHNICAL FEATURES ===

- AI Summarization: Intelligent extraction of categorization-relevant details
- Deterministic Results: Uses temperature=0 and top_p=0 for consistent classifications
- Enhanced Product Identification: Advanced prompting to distinguish products from accessories
- Comprehensive Error Handling: Graceful handling of API errors and edge cases
- Duplicate Removal: Multiple stages of deduplication for clean results
- L1 Deduplication: Ensures no duplicate L1 categories are sent to AI
- Mixed Model Strategy: gpt-4.1-nano for summary and stages 1-2, gpt-4.1-mini for stage 3
- Death Penalty Prompting: Aggressive anti-hallucination prompts threatening "death" for wrong answers
- Zero Context API Calls: Each API call is a blank slate with no conversation history
- Anti-Hallucination Measures: Robust validation and bounds checking in all AI stages
- Unknown L1 Filtering: Stage 2 removes categories with "Unknown" L1 taxonomy
- Multiple Fallback Mechanisms: Graceful handling of invalid AI responses
- Complete Failure Handling: Returns "False" when AI completely fails or returns nothing

=== ENHANCED ANTI-HALLUCINATION MEASURES ===

üéØ SIMPLIFIED PROMPTING SYSTEM:
- All stages use clean, basic prompts with essential instructions only
- Removed complex anti-hallucination language for better AI performance
- Simple system messages focusing on core task requirements
- Clear, straightforward output format specifications

üîí STRICT VALIDATION AT EVERY STAGE:
- Stage 1: Every returned L1 category is validated against the actual L1 list
- Stage 2A/2B: Every returned leaf category is validated against the filtered leaf list  
- Stage 3: AI response is validated to be numeric and within valid range
- All hallucinations are logged as CRITICAL errors with full context

‚úÖ COMPREHENSIVE BOUNDS CHECKING:
- Stage 3 validates AI returns only numbers between 1 and max options
- All indices are bounds-checked before array access
- Multiple fallback mechanisms for invalid responses
- Returns -1 (False) for any validation failure

üõ°Ô∏è MULTIPLE VALIDATION LAYERS:
- Regex validation for numeric responses in Stage 3
- Exact string matching for category validation in Stages 1 & 2
- Duplicate detection and removal at every stage
- Comprehensive logging of all validation steps

=== VERSION 12.0 IMPROVEMENTS ===

‚úÖ AI-POWERED SUMMARIZATION:
- 40-60 word summaries focused on category identification
- Summaries start with product type for immediate clarity
- Category-relevant details prioritized over general features

‚úÖ LEAF NODE DETECTION FIX:
- Fixed critical bug where non-leaf categories were marked as leaves
- Now correctly checks ALL subsequent paths, not just immediate next line
- Ensures only true end categories are presented for selection

‚úÖ ENHANCED PROMPTING:
- Summaries designed to make taxonomy immediately discernible
- Clear product-type terminology from the first words
- Focus on category-distinguishing features

        Complete taxonomy navigation process with enhanced AI capabilities.
        
        This method orchestrates the entire classification pipeline:
        1. Stage 1: AI selects top 2 L1 taxonomy categories
        2. Stage 2A: AI selects first 15 leaf nodes from first L1
        3. Stage 2B: AI selects second 15 leaf nodes from second L1 (skipped if only 1 L1)
        4. Stage 3: AI final selection from combined candidates (skipped if only 1 leaf)
        
        The system includes comprehensive anti-hallucination measures:
        - Professional prompting with explicit constraints
        - Zero context between API calls (no conversation history)
        - Multi-layer validation at every stage
        - Bounds checking for numeric responses
        - Complete failure handling returns "False"
